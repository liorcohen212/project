    <h1 style="background-color: #f2cc0f; ">everything there is to know about mardi gra</h1>
    <div class="fuqs">
    <div class="qu">Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of
        businesses that offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official”
        is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are
        not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise.
        In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New
        Orleans.</div>
    </div><div class="qu">When does Mardi Gras start and end?
        <div class="an">The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday),
        however, is on a different day each year.
        
        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the
        day before Ash Wednesday.
        
        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash Wednesday. Check
        out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.
</div>
    </div><div class="qu">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?
        <div class="an">The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one
        extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a
        warm afternoon.
        
        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t
        forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!</div>
    </div><div class="qu">Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?
        <div class="an">The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a balcony, food and
        a bathroom pass.
</div>
    </div><div class="qu">How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we call it the "Greatest
        Free Show on Earth!"
</div>
    </div><div class="qu">I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus
        and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all
        day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday
        are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
        Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes
        and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.
</div>
    </div><div class="qu">What happens if there is bad weather?
        <div class="an">The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be severe. The local TV
        and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.
</div>
    </div><div class="qu">Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New
        Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade because we used to use "taking
        the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws
        often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.
        
        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We recommend
        seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end
        of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out
        their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't
        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
        
        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which is only 10 minutes
        away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld
        features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!</div>
    </div>
        <div class="qu">Are wheelchairs or scooters available for the elderly/disabled?
            <div class="an">Yes, we let the good times roll for everyone during Mardi Gras! Mobility City of New Orleans offers both short-term and
            long-term rentals of wheelchairs, mobility scooters, etc. They also offer free delivery, setup and pickup (although not
            to the actual parades). Call 504-977-2690 or visit their site.
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qu">I’m bringing my baby/child to Mardi Gras. Will I be able to rent equipment such as car seats, strollers, baby beds, etc?
            <div class="an">Yes! You can enjoy New Orleans with your children knowing they will have all of the comforts of home by renting
            baby/toddler gear from Rockabye Baby Rentals. They rent everything from full-sized wood cribs to pack ‘n plays and
            bassinets, all with freshly laundered linens. They also provide strollers, joggers, and even bottle warmers. Just call
            them at 281-550-7885 for reservations. visit their site
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qu">What are the best ways to get around New Orleans once I've arrived?
            <div class="an">The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or rental car depending on where
            you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be difficult</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qu">Where should I go if someone needs CPR or first aid during a parade?
            <div class="an">Red Cross volunteers, in partnership with New Orleans first responders, will be providing basic first aid in some of the
            most populated areas along the parade routes. They are trained in CPR and first aid and will assist the ill and injured
            at each of their stations positioned along the parade routes.
            
            First aid stations will be available on the following corners along St. Charles Avenue during many of our larger parades
            the last two weeks of Mardi Gras season:
            
            Canal Street | Napoleon Avenue | Washington Avenue | Felicity Street | Lee Circle
            Additionally, first aid stations will be available at Orleans Avenue and North Hennessy Street, as well as North
            Carrolton Avenue and Bienville Street on the Saturday before Mardi Gras for the Endymion parade.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qu">When and where do the Mardi Gras Indians parade?
            <div class="an">The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally the 3rd Sunday closest to St.
            Joseph’s Day in March).
            
            The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their inner-city neighborhoods. Some
            sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9
            a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following
            the Zulu parade.
            
            The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of March, around St.
            Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras
            Indians once again dress in their feathers and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."
            
            For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.
            
            Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday" parade on the Sunday closest to St.
            Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been yet a third Super Sunday
            called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific
            details are available on these events at this time.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="qu">Should we purchase seats for a Grandstand, like the parade reviewing stands on St. Charles Avenue? How can I get
        tickets?
            <div class="an">During Mardi Gras parades, seats aren’t a necessity. Most people at the parades will be standing or even jumping for
            throws—and in between parades, people are walking around and popping into local restaurants for a bite. However, we
            recommend Grandstands for people who may have trouble standing or walking for longer than an hour at a time. For
            Grandstand Tickets, go to New Orleans Parade Tickets.
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qu">How can I find out what this year's Mardi Gras theme will be?
            <div class="an">There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no single organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each
            parade krewe decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret until the parade. Their costumes, floats,
            some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after
            9/11, patriotic themes were popular.
            
            Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are named after the
            neighborhood where they parade.</div>
