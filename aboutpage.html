            <h2>Everything there is to know about Mardigra</h2>
            <p style="background-color: #8cbf3f;">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families and their courts consisting of the season’s debutantes.
            Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat Tuesday gets nearer, the parades start in earnest. Usually
            there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most
            elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur
            throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls</p>
            <p style="background-color: #9453a6;">The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now
            lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an
            observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown
            In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money to fund an
            official Mardi Gras celebration.In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[5] War, economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World War I and
            World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.</p>
            <p style="background-color: #8cbf3f;">Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades running from January
            through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the
            United States as part of a global epidemic.[15] At the time, scrutiny over large public gatherings had yet to emerge,
            while scrutiny over international travel primarily placed an emphasis on restricting travel from China—the country from
            which the disease originated.[16][15] The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was reported on March 9, two weeks after
            the end of Mardi Gras.[17]On November 17, 2020, Mayor Cantrell's communications director Beau Tidwell announced that the city would prohibit parades during Carnival season in 2021. Tidwell once again stressed that Mardi Gras was not "cancelled", but that it
            would have to be conducted safely, and that allowing parades was not "responsible" as they can be superspreading events.Parades were allowed to return for 2022.[31] In December 2021, the city announced that parades would have modified
            routes in 2022 due to New Orleans Police Department staffing shortages.[32][33] On January 6, 2022, Mayor Cantrell
            stated during a kickoff event that "without a doubt, we will have Mardi Gras in 2022", citing high COVID-19 vaccination
            rates,</p>
            <p style="background-color: #9453a6;">The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and ending at Broad
            and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St.
            Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire
            families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller parades and
            walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish Channel Corner Club,
            Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French
            Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne journeys from the
            Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers rambles from bar to
            bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided into uptown and
            downtown tribes, parade in their finery.</p>

                The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and
